#EXPLANATION OF FINAL EDA
### 1. **Basic Data Overview:**
   ```python
   print(df.describe())
   print(df.info())
   ```
   - **Purpose**:
     - `df.describe()` provides summary statistics of all numerical columns. It calculates important metrics like the **mean**, **standard deviation**, **min**, **max**, and **percentiles** (25th, 50th, 75th).
     - `df.info()` shows data types of each column and the count of non-null values, helping identify missing data and the structure of the dataset.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - **Summary statistics** help assess the distribution of features. For example, understanding the range and spread of values helps decide whether any feature needs to be scaled or transformed.
     - **Data types** tell us if any columns need type conversions (e.g., converting categorical columns to numerical ones or datetime).
     - **Missing values**: If any columns have null values, it suggests that imputation or dropping of rows/columns might be necessary.

### 2. **Distribution of Close Prices (Target Variable):**
   ```python
   sns.histplot(df['Close'], bins=30, kde=True, color='blue')
   ```
   - **Purpose**:
     - This histogram shows the **distribution** of the target variable (`Close`), the stock's closing price.
     - **Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)** overlays a smooth curve to show the distribution's shape.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - **Skewness**: The histogram allows you to visually identify if the data is skewed (either left or right). A skewed distribution might indicate a need for a transformation (like log transformation).
     - **Normality**: If the distribution approximates a normal (bell-shaped) curve, it indicates the data is somewhat symmetrically distributed, which might be a good indicator for many modeling techniques.
     - **Outliers**: The histogram can highlight extreme outliers. Extreme spikes or dips might require special handling, like capping the outliers or using robust models.

### 3. **Correlation Heatmap (Features vs Target and Feature-to-Feature Correlation):**
   ```python
   correlation_matrix = df.corr()
   sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f', linewidths=0.5)
   ```
   - **Purpose**:
     - **Correlation Matrix** shows the **correlations** between every pair of features (including the target `Close`). Each value represents how strongly two features are related to each other, ranging from -1 to 1.
     - The heatmap uses color intensity to visually depict these correlations.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - **Positive Correlation**: Features with a high positive correlation to the target (Close price) could be more valuable in predicting the price. For example, if `SMA_50` (50-day simple moving average) correlates strongly with the closing price, it’s likely useful for prediction.
     - **Negative Correlation**: Features with negative correlations (closer to -1) might indicate inverse relationships.
     - **Multicollinearity**: High correlations between independent features (like `SMA_10` and `SMA_50`) suggest multicollinearity, where two or more features are predicting the same information. This could cause problems in linear models but is not as critical for tree-based models like Random Forest.
     - **Target-Feature Relationship**: The correlation with `Close` is crucial, as it tells you which features are most likely to be predictive of future stock prices.

### 4. **Scatter Plot of Features vs Target (Close):**
   ```python
   sns.scatterplot(x=df['SMA_10'], y=df['Close'], color='green')
   ```
   - **Purpose**:
     - A **scatter plot** helps visualize the **relationship** between an individual feature (`SMA_10`) and the target variable (`Close`).
   - **Interpretation**:
     - **Linear or Non-linear Relationship**: If the points form a clear straight line, there’s likely a linear relationship. If the points follow a curved path, it suggests a non-linear relationship, which could be captured by non-linear models like Random Forest.
     - **Outliers**: Outliers will be clearly visible as points far away from the general trend. For example, if a few data points have a very high or low closing price for a given `SMA_10`, it may suggest they’re outliers.
     - **Spread**: The width of the scatter also indicates how much variance exists in the relationship. A wider scatter indicates a more volatile relationship, while a narrow scatter indicates a more predictable relationship.

### 5. **Pairwise Scatter Plots (Selected Features vs Each Other):**
   ```python
   sns.pairplot(df[selected_features])
   ```
   - **Purpose**:
     - **Pairplot** displays scatter plots for each pair of selected features, helping understand the **interaction** between multiple features.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - **Multicollinearity**: You can observe whether certain features are highly correlated with each other. This could help in feature selection (removing highly correlated features to avoid redundancy).
     - **Non-linear Patterns**: Non-linear relationships might show as curved or complex patterns in the scatter plots, suggesting the need for non-linear models or transformations.
     - **Feature Grouping**: You can also spot if features tend to cluster together, which might indicate relatedness, for example, `SMA_10` and `SMA_50` might cluster because they both measure the average price over different periods.

### 6. **Feature Distribution (Histograms for Key Features):**
   ```python
   df[features].hist(bins=30, figsize=(12, 8), layout=(3, 2))
   ```
   - **Purpose**:
     - This step visualizes the **distribution** of selected features using histograms.
     - Helps assess the **spread** of each feature and whether they are normally distributed.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - **Skewness**: If a feature is skewed (left or right), applying transformations like log or square root might help improve model performance.
     - **Outliers**: If the histogram shows very tall bars at one end (indicating extreme values), those may need to be addressed by removing outliers or applying robust techniques.

### 7. **Time-Series Plot of 'Close' Price:**
   ```python
   plt.plot(df['Close'], label='Close Price')
   ```
   - **Purpose**:
     - If the data includes a time component, this **time series plot** helps visualize trends, volatility, and seasonality in the stock price over time.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - **Trends**: An upward or downward trend in the price could suggest momentum or mean reversion. You may decide to use trend analysis or additional time-series forecasting techniques for improved modeling.
     - **Volatility**: Large fluctuations in the price can highlight periods of high market uncertainty or reaction to external events.
     - **Seasonality**: If the plot shows repeating patterns over time, it could suggest that the data follows a seasonal behavior.

### 8. **Boxplots for Outliers in Numerical Features:**
   ```python
   sns.boxplot(data=df[features])
   ```
   - **Purpose**:
     - A **boxplot** helps identify outliers by showing the interquartile range (IQR), median, and the spread of the data for each feature.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - **Outliers**: Points outside the whiskers (1.5 * IQR above the 75th percentile or below the 25th percentile) are potential outliers.
     - **Feature Distribution**: A boxplot provides a quick view of the symmetry of the data, and the presence of skewness or normality.
     - **Feature Importance**: If certain features have extreme outliers or non-normal distributions, it could indicate the need for normalization or transformation.

### Conclusion

Each of these EDA steps is designed to help understand the structure and behavior of the data. The goal is to explore:

1. **Relationships** between features and target.
2. **Distributions** of data to identify issues like skewness or outliers.
3. **Correlations** among features to guide feature selection.
4. **Time patterns** if applicable.

After performing these steps, you’ll have a much clearer idea of the data's characteristics, potential data preprocessing needs, and which features are likely to be most important for modeling. This understanding will guide you in building better predictive models for stock price forecasting.
