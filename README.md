# Stock Price Prediction System

## Overview
This project implements a **Stock Price Prediction System** using machine learning models. The goal of this system is to predict the future closing price of a stock and provide actionable buy, sell, or hold signals based on the prediction. The project uses **Random Forest Regressor** as the main model for prediction and generates actionable insights from the predicted stock prices.

## Key Features
- **Predict Future Stock Prices**: The system predicts the closing price of a stock for the next time period.
- **Actionable Insights**: The system provides buy, sell, or hold signals based on the predicted price.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: The prediction model is based on a Random Forest Regressor, which is an ensemble machine learning model.
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need Python (preferably 3.8+) and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter notebook (optional for testing and analysis)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Clone the Repository
To get started with the project, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

## How to Use

1. **Prepare the Data**: The dataset should include columns such as the closing stock price, moving averages (SMA), exponential moving averages (EMA), and other stock-related technical indicators.

2. **Train the Model**: The `train_model.py` script trains the **Random Forest Regressor** model on historical stock data. The training process involves feature selection, data splitting, and training the model.

3. **Make Predictions**: Once the model is trained, you can use the `predict.py` script to make predictions on the test data. The predictions will be the stock's closing price for the next time period.

4. **Generate Buy/Sell/Hold Signals**: Based on the predicted price, the system will generate the following signals:
   - **Buy**: If the predicted price is higher than the current price.
   - **Sell**: If the predicted price is lower than the current price.
   - **Hold**: If the predicted price is similar to the current price.

Example usage:

```bash
python predict.py
```

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. Lower values indicate better model performance.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable (stock price) explained by the model. R² closer to 1 indicates better performance.

## Results
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Lower MSE values represent better model predictions.
- **R-squared Score**: A higher R² score indicates that the model is explaining most of the variance in the stock prices.

## Future Enhancements
- **Model Optimization**: Explore and implement hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest Regressor or try other advanced models like XGBoost or LSTM.
- **User Interface**: Create a web or desktop application to allow users to input stock tickers and view predictions and signals.
